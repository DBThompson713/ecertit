The information practices of the Website

We may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information.  Generally this information is requested when you register for an online service or when you provide information in connection with an online service.  For example when you enter a contest or other promotional event, we may ask your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.  If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we need to correspond with you, or deliver a service for example, we will let you know how we will use such information.  If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.  You will also have the option to provide other personal information voluntarily.

<p>We will take reasonable steps to destroy your personal information when it is no longer needed by us.

    <h2>3. Using your personal information</h2>
<p>Any personal information collected by Us will be treated as confidential.
